	What is a nojcoin?

		Nojcoin is the latest rage in the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> hype.
		Just like <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">bitcoin</a>, <a href="http://dogecoin.com/">dogecoin</a>, and others like them,
		nojcoin aims to be <b><i>the</i></b> currency used for goods and services in the web as well as the real world.
	%p
		How does it work you ask? Simple.  Just like bitcoins, in order to obtain
		nojcoins, you must mine for them.  However, <b><i>nojcoins are extremely
		rare, and only one has been found so far</i></b>.  Legend has it that there
		might only be one.  However, we still hold hope, that if we mine long
		enough, perhaps with a bit of luck, we'll be able to find ourselves some
		shiny new nojcoins.

		In the interim, this website is dedicated to keep track of the one coin, the one true nojcoin.  You can find the source code for this project in <a href="https://github.com/mdayaram/nojcoin">Github</a>.
