	What is a nojcoin?

.about
	%p
		Nojcoin is the latest rage in the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> hype.
		Just like <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">bitcoin</a>, <a href="http://dogecoin.com/">dogecoin</a>, and others like them,
		nojcoin aims to be <b><i>the</i></b> currency used for goods and services in the web as well as the real world.
	%p
		How does it work you ask? Simple.  Just like bitcoins, in order to obtain nojcoins, you must
		<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mine</a> for them.  However, <b><i>nojcoins are extremely rare,
		and only one has been found so far</i></b>.  Legend has it that there might only be one, one
		nojcoin to rule them all.  However, we still hold hope, that if we mine long enough, perhaps
		with a bit of luck, we'll be able to find ourselves some shiny new nojcoins.
